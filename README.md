# KotN Showdown Graphics

kotn-graphics-bundle is a [NodeCG](http://github.com/nodecg/nodecg) bundle. It was developed and run in version 1.3.0. It may work with future versions, but there's no guarantee that it will work on anything else.

## Examples
Only two graphics were ready in time for the event, the lower third and the timer. If you do some digging you can find the remnants of other planned features.
